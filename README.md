#  Power BI Projects — Data Visualization & Analysis

Welcome to my **Power BI** repository, a collection of projects focused on developing strong data visualization and analytical skills through real-world use cases.

##  Goals

This repository aims to:

* Strengthen my ability to create insightful dashboards and visual reports.
* Practice data cleaning, modeling, and storytelling using Power BI.
* Explore various business datasets and extract meaningful insights.
* Learn to build solutions useful for data-driven decision-making.

The repository is structured as follows:

* `01_getting_started/` — Basics of Power BI, interface, first visualizations.
